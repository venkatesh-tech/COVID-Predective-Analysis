# COVID Data Visualization for Quality Education

## Problem Statement
During these tough times safety is the utmost importance of the students and teachers. At the same time, classes must be conducted as usual. So, we came up with an idea where we use the data of current COVID cases all over the world and predict whether the classes can be conducted through online or offline based on the COVID statistics.

## Description
- This Machine Learning model predicts whether the students to attend online or offline classes by collecting data from an API that is    hosted in a static website made with Reactjs. The data is given in the form of a pie chart which is a pictorial representation of data.
- This machine learning model is powered by Lobe. Lobe is a highly specialized platform for Machine Learning projects that users can teach their model how to work based on image classification. Lobe has everything you need to bring your machine learning ideas to life.

## Purpose behind this Project
We have done this project as part of HACK THE MOUNTAINS 2.O Hackathon.

## Technology Stack
